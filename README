# Presentation about trust

When one system communicates with another system, there needs to be some form of trust between them.

It may be as simple as being on the same host, so just let anyone through.
Or it may be super elaborate public/private keys or Kerberose tickets.

This is trying to explain the various components and how that trust is established.

It is also showing that in the end of the day, all passwords are stored in a file somewhere.

missing:
  ReST -> apache (is this different from user -> apache?)
  -> NFS (other vmdb.yml passwords)
  User -> console (deprecating)
  smart proxy / powershell_daemon

mouse over line:
  list of options
    identity user provides
      password / hostaccess
    where is user identity stored?
    where is md5 stored?
    id to hilight for fetching identity
  id to alternate workflows (if stored elsewhere)

would be nice to include svg in diagram rather than having an external reference
guard file is poised to do that, but it is not showing the images correctly

after editing user.svg, optimize it (get rid of the extra desc and id)
currently editing them in iVinci
